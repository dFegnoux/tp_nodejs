# NodeJS exercise

A simple chat in NodeJS with socket.io. I followed a turorial on [openclassroom](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/des-applications-ultra-rapides-avec-node-js/socket-io-passez-au-temps-reel). Now i'm trying to improve it with new functions and style.

## So, what we have today?
* User can :
  * connect to the chat by using a nickname
  * see last 10 messages of the chat
  * send messages to the chat (duh)
  * see online users
  * see if users are writting a message

## What will be added?
* Prevent user to use same nickname
* Put a better style
* Show that user is writting directly on user list
* Add avatar for users
* Let users change their nickname
  * and notify other users of the nickname changes
* Add channels
* Add private messages (I think it's the same of channels we'll see)
* Possibility to flag a user by clicking on it's nickname or just write @user_nickname
  * Notify flagged user of that message

I hope that listing that will help me to work on a specific task faster than by asking myself "What the hell should continue with?" :)
